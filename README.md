# Depmap Experiment Creation

This is a README file for the depmapexp project.

The project is structured as follows:

- `depmapexp.py`: This file contains the main functions for data preprocessing, experiment creation, and data analysis.
- `test_depmapexp.py`: This file contains unit tests for the functions in `depmapexp.py`.


To configure and execute the main file (`depmapexp.py`), follow these steps:

1. Open the `config.toml` file and configure the necessary parameters.
2. Run the main file with the command `python depmapexp.py`.

To run the unit tests in `test_depmapexp.py`, use the command `pytest test_depmapexp.py`.
